    I have been away from writing anything for a long time and instead have been
    fooling around with other stuffs like just plain reading, growing mustache,
    trying to learn swimming, trying to learn to play acoustic guitar and trying
    my hands at photography. To be honest I have not given up on them yet but
    neither have I been able to hang on to them in a disciplined manner. So here
    I am back to my writing after a long gap.

    This time its going to be quick notes on <strong>Git</strong>.

    <li><h4 align="justify">Git is a file repository.</h4></li>
    <li>
      <h4 align="justify">
        As opposed to other repositories like SVN Git thinks of its data more
        like a snapshot of a mini filesystem.

    <li>
      <h4 align="justify">
        All operations in Git are local. (Entire history of the project is
        stored locally in your working directory)

      <h4 align="justify">Git uses Checksum to track repository items</h4>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><h5 align="justify">Everything in Git is check-summed</h5></li>
      <li><h5>It uses SHA-1 hash for generating check sum values</h5></li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>All actions in Git only add data to Git database.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>There are three main states in Git</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Committed – means that data is safely stored in your local database
        </h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Modified – means you have modified the files but have not yet
          committed to your local database.
        </h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Staged – means that you have marked a modified file in its current
          version to go into your next commit snapshot.
        </h5>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Correspondingly there are three main sections of a Git Project –</h4>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Git directory (repository) – is where Git stores the metadata and
          object database for the project. This is what is copied when you clone
          a repository from another computer.
        </h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Staging Area - is a simple file, generally contained in your Git
          directory, which stores information about what will go into your next
          commit. Also referred to as the index.
        </h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          Working Directory – is a single checkout of one version of the
          project.
        </h5>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>There are two types of files</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>Tracked – files that were part of the last snapshot</h5></li>
      <li>
        <h5>
          UnTracked – any files in your working directory that was not in your
          last snapshot and is not in your staging area.
        </h5>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>Basic Git Workflow –</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>You modify your files</h5></li>
      <li><h5>You stage the files</h5></li>
      <li><h5>You do a commit.</h5></li>
